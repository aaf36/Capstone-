In the realm of justice, where courage is our stone,
Hadi, Ahmad, Adada, Nour, Ali, Mhf, we've grown.
Together we stand, a resolute capstone,
In the battle 'gainst corruption, we're not alone.

Hadi's wisdom, a beacon in the night,
Ahmad's courage, a blaze of pure light,
Adada's determination, a guiding star,
Nour's integrity, from near and far.

Ali's resolve, unwavering and true,
Mhf's strength, in all that they do,
With unity's power, our voices shall resound,
In this battle, our stance, ever profound.

In the pursuit of justice, we stand hand in hand,
With the capstone of truth, we make our stand,
To mend the fractures, corruption did sow,
With our hearts full of purpose, we'll see this through, we'll show.

This group, unyielding, our mission the same,
To fight against injustice, we'll stake our claim,
With the capstone of justice, our vision unfurls,
A world free from corruption, for all boys and girls.
